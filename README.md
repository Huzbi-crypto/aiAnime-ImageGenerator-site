# Introduction

This is the public repo for the AI generated anime art site that I've created as practice for front-end web development.

It uses the huggingface api key to use the model.

Credits for the model goes to [Ojimi](https://huggingface.co/Ojimi/anime-kawai-diffusion).

## Instructions

### Clone Method

1. You can `git clone` this repo,
2. Open the `script.js` file and change the value where it says `apiKey` with your own huggingface api (it's free!), generate the images.
