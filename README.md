# Introduction

This is the public repo for the AI generated anime art site that I've created as practice for front-end web development.

It uses the huggingface api key to use the model.

Credits for the model goes to [Linaqruf](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0).

## Instructions

### Clone Method

1. You can `git clone` this repo,
2. Open the `script.js` file and change the value where it says `apiKey` with your own huggingface api (it's free!), generate the images.


### Visiting the Site

You can directly visit the [site](https://huzbi-animeartai.vercel.app/) to check it out!

#### Please be patient with generating, sometimes the generation can fail due to unsucessful resource fetch.
